A systems approach emerged in the 1950s to describe a holistic and analytical approach to management and problem solving.
* Structural Frame: Roles and responsibilities, coordination and control.Organizational cxharts help describe this frame*
* Human resources frame: Providing harmony between needs of organization and needs of people*
* Political frame: Coalitions composed of varied individuals and interest groups. Conflict and power are the key issues
* Symbolic frame: Symbols and meanings related to events. Culture, language,traditions and image are the parts of this frame*
* Matrix Organization: middle ground between functional and project structures; personnel often report to two or more bosses; structure can be weak, balanced, or strong matrix*

A deliverable is a product or service produced or provided as part of a project

Waterfall model: has well-defined, linear stages of systems development and support


Spiral model: shows that software is developed using an iterative or spiral approach rather than a linear approach

Prototyping model: used for developing prototypes to clarify user requirements

Rapid Application Development (RAD) model:  used to produce systems quickly without sacrificing quality

Agile means being able to move quickly and easily, but some people feel that project management, as they have seen it used, does not allow people to work quickly or easily

Agile today means using an approach where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration

According to the Scrum Alliance, Scrum is the leading agile development method for completing projects with a complex, innovative scope of work.
